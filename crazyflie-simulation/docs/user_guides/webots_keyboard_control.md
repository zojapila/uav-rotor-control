>This example runs in Webots 2023b.

Then just run the following

    webots webots/worlds/crazyflie_world.wbt


Or open up the world by the menu item `file`>`open world...`.


You'll see a crazyflie take off. You can now click the 3d world to make sure it is active, and use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control it.
The script in the console should provide further instructions.
